I always say don't knock it till you try it. I also had their salmon sushi. The rolls fell apart slightly but tasted good. After my meal I realized why they charge $12 for a drink. I left with a wonderful buzz and no mad cow disease from the boiled brains. I say that's worth a rant and a rave. Would recommend to anyone who'd like to try something new.",

There were a few people at the bar and my family sat on the couch and relaxed as we talked and sipped our drinks. Our server Joe was very friendly and let us take our time with the menu and helped my sister pick which drink she wanted.

I would highly recommend staying here, especially if you're in town for a musical event like I was.
